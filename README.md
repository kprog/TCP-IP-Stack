### NetStack a TCP/IP stack written in Perl

The goal of this project is to create a complete RFC compliant TCP/IP Stack in Perl. This project
is being developed solely for educational and research purposes by computer science students at the 
University of Vancouver Island. 

### Goals

* RFC compliant across all layers
* Layer isolation ie. a layer can only see what is above and below it on the stack

### TODO

* benchmark threads/evented model for handling incoming packets
* TCP module
